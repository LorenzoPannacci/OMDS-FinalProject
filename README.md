# OMDS-FinalProject

Final project for the course "Optimization Methods for Data Science and Laboratory" @ MSc Data Science, Sapienza Universit√† di Roma, 2023-24.

The project is about the implementation from scratch (Python Numpy) and with a particular attention to the optimization point of view of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network and two different approaches at the training of a Support Vector Machine (SVM), first by solving numerically the dual problem and then by using Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) with Most Violating Pair (MVP) as Working Set Selection Rule (WSSR), with solutions of subproblems solved analytically.

The project was rated with top marks.
